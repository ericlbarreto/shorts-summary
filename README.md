## Shorts Summary 👨‍💻

I developed this tool at RockeatSeat's Artificial Intelligence NLW, for three days they taught front-end, back-end and AI principles, developing this tool that summarizes Youtube Shorts.

## ✅ How to use:

- You need to have NPM or YARN to download the dependencies, after that type the following command in your IDE:
  > npm install
- After that, in a terminal, type the command:
  > npm run server
- Open another terminal and type the command:

  > npm run web

- A "localhost" link will appear to access the website

## 📚 New Learnings

- Better file separation, modularization, import...
- Another front-end experience with CSS, HTML and JS
- I expanded my knowledge of JavaScript, NodeJS and NPM, as I haven't used them many times, but I'm contextualizing myself in these areas.
- Use of FFMPEG and PIPELINE from XENOVA/TRANSFORMES, which are artificial intelligences to transcribe audio texts and summarize.
- Integration of Front with Back, requests, GET, POST method...
